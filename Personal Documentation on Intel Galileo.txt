{When you create a bootable drive with the memory card, the memory card is partitioned}

{SD card formatter could be a useful for restoring a memory card after one had used it for the galileo. the sd card formatter clears all partitions.}


Extract the windows32 disk manager. this is used to create a bootable sd card for the linux yocto image.

Extract the yocto image which is a .zip file.

open the extracted folder and run the setup

Select the yocto image from the extracted folder.
Select the correct drive to be flashed
Then click write and wait for the process to be done.

This process of creating a bootable sd card for the galileo is Operating system Independent. 

This implies that once the sd card is made bootable with either of , Windows;Mac or ubuntu, the bootable drive will still connect the intel Galileo to a pc irrespective of the operating system.

When the process is done, you should get an alert box saying "Write Successful!"
Eject the SD card

Arduino installed on ubuntu could not download the board manager for intel Galileo gen 2. it gave out this error whenever I tried to click install for the board manager.

How to fix the error "Failed to set up SDK" for arduino on ubuntu

The steps I have followed are:

    Install the board through the arduino IDE.
        This was accomplished through the Board manager which appears on the picture you have placed on this post.
        After installing the board an error occured, but no worries, this will be solved later.

    Modify the files which relocate sdk.
        Open terminal ctrl + alt + T
        Acces as root user sudo su (and enter your password)
        Move to the following folder cd /root/.arduino15/packages/Intel/tools/i586-poky-linux-uclibc/1.6.2+1.0/i586
        Then execute the following: gedit install_script.sh
        On the opened file search for the lines which start with "executable_files" and change the "+111" characters for "/111"
        After saving, go back to the terminal and execute ./install_script.sh

Enjoy your working intel galileo gen2 bord!


To resolve permission denied error temporarily 
run this code;
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 to give Read-write access to the port.

This fixes the error temporarily, but whenever you disconnect the galileo you would have to run this code again.

To make this permanent, do the following.
run the following code

sudo usermod -a -G dialout victor {if your username is victor}

Restart your computer and you are all setup to use Intel Arduino on ubuntu... Voila.
